    <p id="more"> Welcome to Tim DeXter Initiatives official website. Tim DeXter Initiative is a platform that's trying to bring change to the world today by making people understand that being different is normal, and that's what makes each one of us unique in our own way. And we show that change through our web design, graphic design and much more. So we shouldn't be critisised by our beliefs, skin color or choices, but rather we should accept our selfs and others for being who we are.The <em>The Tim DeXter Initiative</em> is not just a platform or another starting organisation, it's a medium to show people can achieve any height they desire, and yes even people from third world countries. It's a way of saying that you're not belittled because of where you come from, We at Tim Dexter Initiative see it as our little voice in the world today. It's not just a dream but a goal, it's a way of showing that we can!, and we show this through the excellent things we do every day. We shouldn't see where we come from as a limitation but we should see it as one of our greatest strength because it makes our work different (Unique), we should never feel shy of showing who we are, we should always show that special <em>odd</em> part of us, even if its socially strange, or weird to some people. Show the world who you are!. Normal is underrated, the world needs something different, it needs people like you!. Be Creative with Tim Dexter Iniative.  </p>
